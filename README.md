This is your first mini-project!

Let's take a step back and try to combine some of our TypeScript knowledge in a small mini-project. Please try to avoid Co-pilot or other ChatGPT program in this mini-project but feel free to Google and search, if you don't understand some TS concepts.

All you have to do is complete the functions in the **variations.ts** file.

Note that a single error in the variations.ts file would break all the tests. For that reason, you should start by providing the type of the name parameter for all five functions. If you're not sure what the type must be, add a console.log and try the mini-project.
